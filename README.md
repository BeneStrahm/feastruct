This repo was forked from [feastruct](https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/feastruct/).

The author is very grateful to Robbie van Leeuwen for this package and has adapted it with his needs for use in his PhD-Thesis **B. Strahm, "On the Design for Reuse of Segmented Concrete Slabs", 2026**. 

The package was used in a software implementation and served for the pre- and postprocessing of a FE-Analysis. The implementation can be found under the Dataset **B. Strahm, "On the Design for Reuse of Segmented Concrete Slabs: Software Implementation for the Generation of Segments", 2025, [doi](https://doi.org/10.18419/DARUS-5580)**.
